# Social Proof Logic Improvements - Complete

## 🎯 **PROBLEM FIXED**

The dynamic social proof system had critical logical inconsistencies where it would show people ordering when the restaurant was closed, creating unrealistic and misleading social proof.

**Examples of Fixed Issues:**
- ❌ "Restaurant Geschlossen • Öffnet in 10h 0min" but also "👥 8 Leute bestellen gerade"
- ❌ Urgency messages showing when no service was available
- ❌ Delivery estimates not adapting to closed status
- ❌ Recent order times showing "vor 3 Min" when restaurant has been closed for hours

## ✅ **IMPROVEMENTS IMPLEMENTED**

### 🧠 **Restaurant Status Integration**
- **✅ Smart Context Awareness**: `getSocialProofData()` now checks restaurant status first
- **✅ Realistic Closed State**: Shows 0 people ordering when closed, small viewing count instead
- **✅ Dynamic Recent Orders**: "vor 2h" instead of "vor 3 Min" when closed
- **✅ No False Urgency**: Urgency messages disabled when closed or closing soon

### 📊 **Data Logic Improvements**
```typescript
// When restaurant is closed:
return {
  orderingCount: 0, // Nobody ordering when closed
  viewingCount: getRandomInRange(2, 5), // Some people still viewing menu
  recentOrderTime: "vor 2h", // Last order was hours ago
  urgencyMessage: undefined, // No urgency when closed
  isRestaurantOpen: false,
  restaurantStatus,
};
```

### 🚚 **Delivery Time Intelligence**
- **✅ Closed State Handling**: Shows "Geschlossen (öffnet in Xh)" when closed
- **✅ Opening Time Integration**: Calculates delivery time from next opening + prep time
- **✅ Closing Soon Awareness**: Adds urgency when restaurant is about to close

### 🌐 **User Interface Improvements**
- **✅ Contextual Messages**: Different text for ordering vs viewing vs closed states
- **✅ Smart Display Logic**: 
  - Open + ordering: "X Leute bestellen gerade"
  - Open + no orders: "X schauen sich die Speisekarte an"
  - Closed: "X schauen sich die Speisekarte an"
- **✅ Translation Support**: Added DE/EN keys for all new states

### 🔧 **Component Updates**
1. **`src/utils/socialProof.ts`**: Core logic with restaurant status integration
2. **`src/ui/Home.tsx`**: Smart social proof display logic
3. **`src/features/order/CheckoutForm.tsx`**: Contextual ordering messages

6. **`src/i18n/locales/en.json`**: Complete bilingual support

## 🎭 **BEHAVIORS BY STATE**

### 🟢 **When Restaurant is OPEN**
- **Ordering Count**: 8-20 people (realistic peak/weekend bonuses)
- **Recent Orders**: "vor 1-15 Min" 
- **Urgency Messages**: 30% chance to show
- **Delivery Time**: 15-45 min based on demand
- **Message**: "X Leute bestellen gerade"

### 🟡 **When Restaurant is CLOSING SOON**
- **Ordering Count**: Normal levels but no urgency messages
- **Recent Orders**: Still realistic timing
- **Urgency Messages**: Disabled to prevent pressure
- **Delivery Time**: Shows closing time warning
- **Message**: Standard ordering text

### 🔴 **When Restaurant is CLOSED**
- **Ordering Count**: 0 (nobody can order)
- **Viewing Count**: 2-5 people browsing menu
- **Recent Orders**: "vor 2h" (hours ago)
- **Urgency Messages**: None
- **Delivery Time**: "Geschlossen (öffnet in Xh)"
- **Message**: "X schauen sich die Speisekarte an"
